Postpartum Depression Factors

Data set is about factors impacting a womans chance of having postpartum depression. It is calculated based on the Edinburg Postnatal Depression Scale, in which certain factors are reviewed that can either lead to depression or not lead to it. Examples of this includes smoking, maritial status, previous diagnosis of post partum depression, and more. These mothers were analyzed 4 weeks after they had given birth.

With this data set, I looked at how maternal age impacted post partum depression and develed deeper into the age categories to see which ages were impacted the most. I also looked at how losing a child(s) may impact post partum depression. I did this by looking at number of living children vs births, in which if those numbers didn't add up then there was a loss of a child.
